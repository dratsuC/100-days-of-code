# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Got started with The Odin Project - focused largely on mindest and focus, thinking about dedication despite failures and fostering a growth mindset

**Thoughts:** It was really useful to go back over this stuff, as i had forgotten just how much i love learning after working at Infosys

### Day 2: December 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up a VM on the Windows PC, and getting some things set up on the Macbook too - mostly prep for coding further down the line

**Thoughts:** Not very deep, but it was super nice to start getting everything set up again after so long
