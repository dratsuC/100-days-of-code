### Day 15: January 5, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Added some more styling to the Odin Recipes site, and completed the first lesson on flexbox

**Today's Progress**: After a short break due to work commitments/changes, I finished the flex box lessons and also documented my learnings so far on paper so I can easily refer to them moving forwards
