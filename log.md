### Day 12: January 2, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Box lesson, including an interactive lesson by MDN

**Thoughts:** This stuff can get a little confusing, especially differentiating between the different display modes (inline-flex vs inline-block???), but it's so good to revisit

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 13: January 3, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Completed inline block lessons 1 and 2

**Thoughts:** box stuff makes a little more sense now - just have to make it through flexbox lmao

### Day 14: January 4, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Odin Recipes site - adding extra styling relating to <div> and inline/block display

**Thoughts:** Site still looks pretty terrible, but it's way better than when it first started! Super keen to get into more advanced styling/layout options

### Day 15: January 5, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Added some more styling to the Odin Recipes site, and completed the first lesson on flexbox

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is way less scary than I remember it - I know there's more to learn but at its core its quite simple

### Day 16: January 12, 2025

**Today's Progress**: After a short break due to work commitments/changes, I finished the flex box lessons and also documented my learnings so far on paper so I can easily refer to them moving forwards

**Thoughts:** I took a cheeky look at the curriculum and saw that JS is very close, I am SO KEEN

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 17: January 13, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Smashed through the remaining flexbox lessons and tackled one of the interactive tests in the assignment section - still a few more assignments to get through yet

**Thoughts:** Taking down paper notes has made this WAY EASIER to retain, and the interactive lesson from Josh Comeau was hugely helpful in cementing the ideas from this lesson

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 18: January 14, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Finished flex lessons 01 and 02 in the CSS repo

**Thoughts:** I got pretty stuck on the second lesson, where I had to use lots of nested flexboxes - took me a while but taught me a LOT

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 19: January 15, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Finished flex lessons 03, 04 and 05 in the CSS repo

**Thoughts:** Really good to reinforce all the concepts from the flex lessons, can't wait to implement this stuff in my own websites :D

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 20: January 16, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Finished the remaining lessons (06 and 07) for flexbox

**Thoughts:** The final CSS lessons for flex really drove home the basic concepts of flex and how to achieve some of the most common web layouts in a very simple way - I LOVE IT

### Day 21: January 22, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Significant progress on final project for HTML/CSS on Odin (started it a few days ago, but not much progress was made so I didn't log it)

**Thoughts:** Added main HTML structure and content, and styled 90% of the page to a basic degree. I can see that this is going to be the format of my personal practise going forward; find a brief, fulfill it, add to portfolio.

### Day 22: January 24, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Odin landing page project is complete!

**Thoughts:** Webpage still contains dummy text, but I think it still serves as a good marker for huge progress on my understanding of layout and design through HTML/CSS --- NOW ONTO JAVASCRIPT!!!

### Day 23: January 29, 2025
